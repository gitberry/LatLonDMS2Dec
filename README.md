# LatLonDMS2Dec
simple utility to convert Lat/Lon DMS coordinates to D decimal

This can be a simple utility - or with extra parameters become a very handy                                      
tool for outputing consistently formatted GEOGRAPHIC data.                                                       

Original incentive to build was when I had a need to process EXIF data from iPhone photos into geographic map.
